# rustFetch

rustFetch is a simple project I started while learning programming. The goal was to create my own version of Neofetch
 in Rust.

⚠️ This is not a production-ready project. There are more complete and feature-rich alternatives available.

Currently, it’s more of an experimental project and a way for me to practice Rust and system programming as I am a beginner.
